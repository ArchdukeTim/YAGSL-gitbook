# ‚ùå Check your gyroscope

## Define a front and expect to change it.

It's easiest to define a front, maybe it's one that you want but expect to change it. Relative locations of modules are determined by the gyroscope. If your gyroscope is installed in the wrong orientation and can't be changed you WILL have to compensate for it in code that is not in any existing examples or apart of YAGSL.&#x20;
