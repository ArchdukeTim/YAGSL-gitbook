# Swerve Information

## Every swerve drive is different!

Even with COTS swerve modules like SDS MK4, and MaxSwerve. Every robot has different dimensions and should not be treated the same.

## Measure module locations

Try to measure module locations in CAD to be as precise as possible and go from the center of the wheel to the center of the robot over the "front" and "left" relative to the robot. The units for this is inches!
